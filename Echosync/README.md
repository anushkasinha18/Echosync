# EchoSync — Real-time Code Collaboration

EchoSync is a minimal, production-ready template for a collaborative code editor built with **React (Vite)** and **Socket.IO**. It lets multiple users edit the same document in real-time inside a shared room.

---

## Features

- 🔗 Room-based collaboration (share the URL to invite others)
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Live presence list (who’s online)
- ⚡ Real-time code syncing via WebSockets (Socket.IO)
- 🧩 Code editor powered by CodeMirror 6 (JavaScript + JSX mode)
- 🧱 Simple Node/Express server with in-memory state
- 🧪 Local dev-friendly setup with Vite (port 5173) & server (port 5000)

> Note: This template keeps room state in memory. For production, back the document with a database and consider CRDT/OT (like Yjs/ShareDB) for conflict-free editing.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (recommended)
- A terminal with two tabs (one for server, one for client)

---

## Quick Start (Local)

1) **Download & unzip** this project.  
2) **Install & run the server:**

```bash
cd Echosync/server
npm install
npm run dev   # starts at http://localhost:5000
```

3) **Install & run the client:**

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
npm run dev   # Vite at http://localhost:5173
```

4) **Open the app:** Go to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.  
   - Enter your name, click **Create new room**, and share the URL with collaborators.  
   - Or paste a **Room ID** to join an existing room.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### 1. Create the project folders

```
Echosync/
  server/
  client/
```

### 2. Build the WebSocket server

- **Express** hosts a tiny HTTP API.  
- **Socket.IO** manages rooms and broadcasts code changes & user presence.

Key events:
- `JOIN({ roomId, username })` — add a socket to the room and broadcast the updated user list.
- `CODE_INIT(code)` — server sends current room code to the new client.
- `CODE_CHANGE(code)` — broadcast code updates to other clients and update server state.
- `USERS([{ socketId, username }])` — room presence list.
- `USER_JOINED` / `USER_LEFT` — simple notifications (you can add toasts).

### 3. Build the client (React + Vite)

- **Home.jsx** collects `username`, creates or joins a `roomId` using React Router.  
- **Room.jsx** sets up a socket connection, joins the room, and listens for events:
  - Apply `CODE_INIT` once on mount.
  - Update editor on incoming `CODE_CHANGE`.
  - Keep a live `users` list using `USERS`.
- **Editor.jsx** wraps CodeMirror 6 with JavaScript+JSX syntax support.
- A tiny debounce prevents sending every keystroke as a WebSocket packet.

### 4. Configure ports & CORS

- Server runs at **http://localhost:5000** with CORS open to all origins (for local dev).
- Client (Vite) runs at **http://localhost:5173** (fixed via `vite.config.js` to avoid port confusion).

### 5. Test with multiple tabs

- Open two browser tabs to the same room URL and watch changes sync instantly.

---

## Environment Variables

Create `client/.env` (or copy `.env.example`):

```
VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

If you deploy the server, change this to your deployed URL.

---

## Production Notes

- Put the server behind HTTPS and configure a proper CORS origin list.
- Persist room documents in a database.
- For conflict-free editing at scale, layer in **CRDT** (e.g., Yjs) or **OT**.
- Add auth & per-room ACLs for private sessions.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Blank page or wrong port?** This project pins Vite to **5173**. Make sure you open `http://localhost:5173`.
- If you see CORS errors, verify `VITE_SERVER_URL` matches your server URL and that the server is running.
- Node version < 18 can cause dependency issues. Upgrade if needed.

Happy hacking!
